Farmers' Market Expansion\n<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown in the database schema below.</p>\n<h5 id=\"databaseschema\">Database Schema</h5>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5960/datasets/463543c8c38957ca5b95d93b02f2cb1bec53334f/diagram.PNG\" alt=\"Database Schema\" width=\"400px\"></p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\npostgresql:///groceries\n    \n\n\nWITH\nT_2019 AS (SELECT \n                    month,\n                    year,\n                    category\n             FROM\n                    purchases_2019\n               LEFT JOIN  categories\n               USING(purchase_id)), \n\nT_2020 AS (SELECT CAST( date_part('month', TO_DATE(fulldate, 'YYYY/MM/DD')) AS INT) as month,\n                  CAST( date_part('year', TO_DATE(fulldate, 'YYYY/MM/DD')) AS INT) as year,\n                  category \n                FROM\n                      purchases_2020\n              LEFT JOIN  categories as c\n               ON c.purchase_id = purchases_2020.purchaseid),\nD_2019 AS ( SELECT \n                   month,\n                   count(*)*1.0 as count_2019\n            FROM \n              T_2019\n              WHERE \n              category IN ('whole milk', 'yogurt' , 'domestic eggs')\n              GROUP BY 1\n),\nD_2020 AS ( SELECT \n                   month,\n                   count(*)*1.0 as count_2020\n            FROM \n              T_2020\n              WHERE \n              category IN ('whole milk', 'yogurt' , 'domestic eggs')\n              GROUP BY 1\n), \nfull_data AS (SELECT *\nFROM D_2020\nLEFT JOIN D_2019\nUSING (month))\n\nSELECT month, \n       count_2020 as total_sales,\n       ROUND ((count_2020 / (SELECT COUNT(*)\n                    FROM T_2020 \n                    WHERE full_data.month = T_2020.month) * 100.0),2) as market_share,\n        ROUND (((count_2020 - count_2019)/count_2019)*100.0,2 ) as year_change\nFROM full_data \nORDER BY 1\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.7","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
